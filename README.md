Text-based RPG adventure game


My first original project in Python. After completing the Python3 Codecademy course, my goal with this game is to demonstrate a basic understanding of introductory Python concepts in an entertaining format, utilizing my creativity and simple logic through syntax. Additionally, I wanted to begin working with GitHub.

Although this is a basic, introductory-level project, I was glad that my battle system worked. I managed to get the enemy_health meter to decrease after each user attack. I also tried to incorporate some good practices, including system messages if the player did not select a given option, ensuring the loops acted correctly, etc. 


This is an ongoing project! Feedback welcome.
