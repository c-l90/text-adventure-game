Text-based RPG adventure game


My first original project in Python. After completing the Python3 Codecademy course, my goal with this project is to demonstrate a basic understanding of introductory Python concepts in an entertaining format, utilizing my creativity and simple logic through its syntax. Additionally, I wanted to begin working with GitHub.

This is an ongoing project! Feedback welcome.
